Weeds in the garden. 

That's reality's default switch. 

Hitting snooze one more time. Skipping the workout. Eating the extra cookie. 

Anxious thoughts. Just one more YouTube video. Dust and cobwebs. 

We have to confront things the way they are. 

Weeds **ARE**. 

The good news? 

By pushing against them, we get stronger.

Reality's default switch is weeds in the garden. 

We can train our response – and, in the process, become exceptionally strong.

Which is why it's vital to remember: 

Reality's default is: weeds in the garden.
