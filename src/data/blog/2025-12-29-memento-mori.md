The past year is in its final throes - dead in just a few days. 

Memento Mori. Remember Death. 

Death is industrial-strength bleach for life's barnacles and bullshit. 

But how often do we submit to death's deep cleansing – without needing to have someone or something close to us perish? 

How easily we forget this most central fact of life - that we, yes we, will die. 

I wrote a song about this - the chorus of which goes:

***"Soon, so soon, we're all gonna be dust."***

(For some reason, ***Dust*** isn't a chart-topping hit - go figure.)

It doesn't seem to matter how many times I remind myself. There's always a need for yet another reminder:

***Memento Mori.***
