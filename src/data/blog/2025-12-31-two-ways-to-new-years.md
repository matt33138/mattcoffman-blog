There are many ways to ring in the New Year...but let's talk about two big ones.

#### Option 1 (the pop culture option): 

Gather with a bunch of people. Drink alcohol. Cheer the countdown to midnight. Stay up until the wee hours of the morning. Wake up late on New Year's Day feeling pretty rough with a nasty hangover. 

#### Option 2 (option 1 flipped upside down - or should I say rightside up):

Enjoy the final night of the year – but get to bed at your usual time. Wake up early on New Year's Day. Get in a great workout, or go for a walk, or sit in meditation for a really strong sit. Attack the first day of the new year with commitment. Accomplish something that matters to you. Plant a strong seed in the ground of the new year on its first day. Enter the new year with momentum. 


Now, obviously, you can tell which option I prefer. 

I never understood option 1. Why set yourself up for a rough first day of a new year? Why wake up hung over on Day 1 of a new year? 

This isn't a midlife thing for me, either. My orientation toward New Year's has always been this way. 

Every New Year's celebration, my goal is to wake up and have the absolute best Day 1 I possibly can. Full of the things I want the new year to be all about – which typically involve health, connection with loved ones, happiness, creativity, positive momentum, and a sense of accomplishment. 


Which is to say: Happy New Year! 

For those of us who get to enjoy a full next year - let's make it the best we possibly can, for all our relations.
