You wake up. It's still dark outside. 

Everyone else in the house is asleep – but not you. 

You committed to working out. Told yourself you would.

But, of course, you don't feel like it. 

Doesn't matter. You put on your workout clothes. Get your keys. Head to the gym. 

Walk in, check in, head to the weights. 

From waking up to getting ready to showing up to actually doing the work - you had to pierce a membrane of "don't want to" each time. 

And then, the actual working out. One rep after the next. Each one a choice. 

What if it never gets easy? 

What if there's no downward slope of "it's a habit" waiting to push you along? 

What if – every time you're faced with the choice of doing what's good for you vs. doing something else – you still have to choose? 

***Especially*** what if the world is seemingly designed to indulge the easy thing and keep you from doing the hard thing? 

What then?
